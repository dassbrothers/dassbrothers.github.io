                <strong>SHAKTI-MS: A RISC-V Processor for Memory Safety in C</strong><br>
                Shakti-MS is a lightweight RISC-V processor with built-in support for both temporal and spatial memory protection. It uses novel concepts like fat-pointers and a modified compiler with new hardware instructions to ensure low runtime overheads.

                <strong>The CoveRT Approach for Coverage Management in Analog and Mixed Signal Integrated Circuits. </strong><br>
                Coverage is a key indicator for verification progress, verification closure, and verification sign-off in an integrated circuit design. The notion of coverage management, namely, the use of coverage information across the design hierarchy to identify verification loopholes, is well understood in the digital context, but requires considerable disambiguation in the analog/mixed-signal (AMS) context. This article develops the core artifacts of AMS coverage and presents a comprehensive coverage management approach based on our tool, CoveRT. Our results, gleaned from live industrial designs, demonstrate the benefits of AMS coverage management across the design hierarchy, both in terms of identifying verification gaps, as well as in finding design bugs.

                <strong>CoVerPlan: A Comprehensive Verification Planning Framework Leveraging PSS Specifications.</strong><br>
                CoVerPlan, is a comprehensive verification framework built to explore the power of action inferencing on test models written in Portable Stimulus Standards (PSS). The proposed verification framework leverages a SAT planner to unwind the actual verification flow from the PSS specifications and automatically synthesizes target-specific constraint-random test benches and formal assertions. CoVerPlan also carries out assertion-based verification of the synthesized properties.

                <strong>PURSE: Property Ordering Using Runtime Statistics for Multi-Property Verification. </strong><br>
                PURSE is the first tool that dynamically reorders the properties on the fly by using the runtime statistics dumped by the Property Directed Reachability (PDR) proof engine while execution. The idea is to reorder the goals on the fly after every iteration based on the statistics dumped from the PDR proof engine, so that hard goals do not hinder the easy ones from getting solved.
